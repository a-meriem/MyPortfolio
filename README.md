## üëã About Me
Hi, I'm Meriem Amara, an Embedded Systems Engineer with a keen interest in Robotics. I have hands-on experience with C, Python, and STM32 microcontrollers, and I'm skilled in developing and optimizing embedded systems. My work spans from creating communication drivers for mobile robots to developing sophisticated navigation algorithms. I thrive on tackling complex problems and enjoy working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.

## üöÄ Projects

### LoRa SX1278 Driver
- **Description:** Developed a driver for the SX1278 LoRa module, including `lora.h` and `lora.c` files. The driver is used for configuring and interfacing with the LoRa module in various applications.
- **Application:** Integrated into an STM32 project demonstrating communication capabilities with the SX1278 module.

### EUROBOT Navigation System
- **Description:** Developed a sophisticated navigation system for a differential wheeled robot, capable of moving from any point A to a point B with less than 1 millimeter of error on the X and Y axis. This project involved 10 months of continuous design, improvement, optimization, and testing on a real robot. The system utilizes state machines and PID controllers for precise navigation.
- **Components:** Includes source and header files for the navigation algorithms, along with a full implementation example for STM32. The project also features a detailed README on configuration and usage.
- **Application:** Demonstrated high-precision navigation in competitive robotics environments.
